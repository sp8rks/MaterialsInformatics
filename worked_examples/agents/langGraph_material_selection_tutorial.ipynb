      "\n",
      "Based on the analysis and trade-offs provided, the best material recommendation for a turbine blade operating at 1250°C under high stress would be nickel-based superalloys. They offer a good balance of properties, cost, and sustainability factors compared to the other options. While tungsten and titanium aluminide also have their advantages, nickel-based superalloys stand out as the most suitable choice for this specific application. Considerations should be given to the specific requirements and priorities of the project to make the final decision.\n"
